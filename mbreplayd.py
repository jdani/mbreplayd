- What is this about:
mbreplayd is a multicast & Broadcast traffic replay daemon for pseudo-bridges
(aka Layer 3 bridges).


- How it works:
The idea is quite simple. What mbreplay does is:
    - sniff for traffic in in_iface
    - choose the packets matcheing BPF filter
    - change the source mac with the out_iface hwaddr
    - send the packet to out_iface

The only point is that, in order to be useful, mbreplayd has to replay packets
received in the out_iface to the in_iface. Every packet but those ones which
src ip is the same that the IP generating this traffic. This filter is setted
up automatically from the bpf_filter


- Ideal scenario:
mbreplayd is usefull to forward broadcast and multicast traffic from in_iface
to out_iface, both of them part of a pseudo-bridge. This is a layer 3 bridge.
For sure, pseudo-bridges is not the best or event the default option to bridge
two interfaces but, sometimes, it needed. For example when a wireles interface
is a bridge member. In that case, is pretty common to need pseudo-bridges. In
my case, the upstream interface in my virtualization server was wireless, so
I decided to solve the problem with unicast traffic using parprouted but I
couldn't do the same with any other software or configuration I tried. So I
decided to write mbreplayd!.


- Known issues:
The main downside of mbreplayd is related to performance. Using python + scapy
to sniff packets, modify and replay them in realtime maybe is not the best way
to go. However, mbreplayd is not intended to be production grade software but
a way to investigate, learn, study and code and, by the way, solve a problem
with my lab environment, which is the ideal scenario for mbreplayd.
